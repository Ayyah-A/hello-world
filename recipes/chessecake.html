        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <h4>For the crust:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine both crushed biscuits, the melted butter, 
                        and the cinnamon with a fork until crumbs are moistened evenly throughout.</li> 
                    <li>Press along the bottom and sides of a lightly greased 9 inch springform pan. </li>
                    <li>Use the base of a measuring cup and press it on to the crumb mixture into the pan to really pack the crumbs tightly down. Let the crust chill a little in the fridge while you prepare cheesecake.</li>
                </ol>
        
        
        
            <h4>For the cheesecake:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 180 C (350 F).</li>
                    <li>Preferably using a stand mixer, combine the cream cheese with the sugar in a large bowl and mix on medium speed until well combined and fluffy. Blend in the milk, then add the eggs one at a time, mixing briefly after each addition.</li>
                    <li>Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour until smooth. It may be easier to sift in the flour.</li>
                    <li>Pour filling into prepared crust. Bake at 180 C for 1 hour, then turn off the oven and leave cheesecake inside for another 5 hours or so until oven has completely cooled. This is to prevent cracking. (Alternately, if baking in a water bath, turn oven off after 1 hour, and leave cheesecake for a further 1 hour in the oven before removing and chilling.)</li>
                    <li>Store cheesecake in fridge after this time period is over until chilled, then you can go on to topping and decorating it.</li>
                </ol>
        
        
            <h4>Topping the cheesecake:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Microwave the lotus spread for the topping for 30 seconds, stirring halfway through. You want it to be runny and melted.</li>
                    <li>Pour the lotus spread over the surface of the chilled cheesecake, using a spatula to spread it evenly.</li>
                    <li>Garnish the top with extra whole lotus biscuits if desired, then place back in the fridge just until lotus spread has set. Serve cold straight out of the fridge.</li>
                </ol>
