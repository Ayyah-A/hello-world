    <h4> Description </h4>
    <p>The most classic homemade pizza, this margherita pizza recipe features a tangy pizza sauce, gooey mozzarella, and a perfect chewy pizza crust.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h5> Pizza Dough</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>ball Best Pizza Dough (or Food Processor Dough or Thin Crust Dough)</li> 
            <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li> 
        </ul>

    <h5> Pizza Sauce</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 small garlic clove (1/2 medium)</li> 
            <li>15 ounces crushed fire roasted tomatoes or high quality organic canned tomatoes</li> 
            <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li> 
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li> 
            <li>Scant ½ teaspoon kosher salt</li> 
            
        </ul>

    <h5> Toppings</h5> 
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 to 1/3 cup pizza sauce</li> 
            <li>¾ cup shredded cheese or 2 to 3 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese</li> 
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li> 
            <li>A few fresh basil leaves</li> 
        </ul>



    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Make the pizza dough: Follow the Best Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)</li>
            <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven (here’s the pizza oven we use).</li>
            <li>Make the pizza sauce: Cut the garlic into a few rough pieces. Place the garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, oregano and kosher salt in a blender. Blend until fully combined. (You’ll use about ⅓ cup for the pizza; reserve the remaining sauce and refrigerate for up to 1 week.)</li>
            <li> Prepare the cheese: If using fresh mozzarella cheese, slice it into ¼ inch thick pieces (see the photos of the pre-baked pizza above). If it’s incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes then dab the mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel. </li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of the pizza sauce over the dough, using about ¼ to ⅓ cup. Add the mozzarella cheese. Top with a thin layer of fresh grated Parmesan cheese and a few pinches of kosher salt.</li>
            <li> Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven).</li>
            <li> Allow the pizza to cool for a minute or two before adding the basil on top (whole leaves, lightly torn, or thinly sliced). Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
